<Font face="Harrington" size="5" color="yellow"> World Music Day is celebrated to gather both ameateur and professional
 musicians on the streets to celebrate the beauty of MUSIC. It is celebrated on 21st June every year. The idea originally 
came from the American musician <b>Joel Cohen</b> who was then working for a French radio station called Radio France. He wanted
 bands to play on the evening of June 21, the very first day of summer, to welcome the return of the SUN.</font>
